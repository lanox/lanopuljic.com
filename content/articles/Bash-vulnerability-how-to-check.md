Summary: How to check if bash is exposed

####Detecting vulnerable versions

To test if your version of Bash is vulnerable to this issue, run the following command:
```bash
 env x='() { :;}; echo vulnerable'  bash -c "echo this is a test"
```

If the output of the above command looks as follows:

```bash

this is a test
```
