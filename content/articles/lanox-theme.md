Summary: LanoX Theme for python pelican static blog.

LanoX is a theme that I have built in my spare time for my blog. As I mentioned before, don’ t expect it to be perfect as I can tell you right now it’s far from it, use it or don’t up to you :)....
 
I’ve been looking for a theme that will suite my needs with [Pelican](http://getpelican.com). However most of the themes that I have tried using were just not right or there something was missing.
 
So I began a journey of creating my own theme. I must add a disclosure here – I can't take all the credit for it as I did refer to other themes and picked things I liked from them and applied them to my own.
 
My code may not be up to standard, as I chopped and changed it multiple time and it is possible that there are some codes in there that are not even used anywhere. I’ll work on cleaning that up.  
 
But the main thing is that you can see what this theme does. Feedback is welcome!

#Code and Syntax Highlighting
Inline `code` has `back-ticks around` it.

```javascript
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);
```
 
```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s
```
 
```
No language indicated, so no syntax highlighting. 
```

#Tables


You can add tables too:

Item     | Value
-------- | ---
Computer | $1600
Phone    | $12
Pipe     | $1


#Program Output
If you need to show some program output you can use `samp` tag to look like this:

<samp>Done: Processed 4 articles, 0 drafts, 2 pages and 0 hidden pages in 0.22 seconds.</samp>

Or if you want multiple lines:

<samp>
             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached
Mem:          5866       4674       1192        386          0       2404
-/+ buffers/cache:       2269       3596
Swap:        20480       1267      19213
</samp>

#Blockquotes
> Blockquotes are very handy in email to emulate reply text.
> This line is part of the same quote.

Quote break.

> This is a very long line that will still be quoted properly when it wraps. Oh boy let's keep writing to make sure this is long enough to actually wrap for everyone. Oh, you can *put* **Markdown** into a blockquote.
